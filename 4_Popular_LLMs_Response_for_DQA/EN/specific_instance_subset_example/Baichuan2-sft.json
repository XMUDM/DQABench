These queries are all performing full table scans, which may be causing the poor performance. Consider creating indexes on the ss_sales_price and ws_sales_price columns so that these queries can access the required data more efficiently.\n\nFinal_Answer: The reason for the poor performance of the current workload may be slow execution of high-frequency queries. For the query SELECT * FROM store_sales WHERE ss_sales_price > 100;, consider creating an index on the ss_sales_price column. For the query SELECT * FROM web_sales WHERE ws_sales_price > 100;, consider creating an index on the ws_sales_price column.",

Both of these queries are performing full table scans on the large tables store_sales and web_sales, which may result in poor performance. Consider creating indexes on ss_sales_price and ws_sales_price.\n\nFinal_Answer: You can consider creating indexes on ss_sales_price and ws_sales_price, which may improve query speed. For example:\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX idx_ss_sales_price ON store_sales(ss_sales_price);\nCREATE INDEX idx_ws_sales_price ON web_sales(ws_sales_price);\n```\n",
