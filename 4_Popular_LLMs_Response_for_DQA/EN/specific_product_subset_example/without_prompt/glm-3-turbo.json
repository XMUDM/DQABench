        "actual_output": "Starting openGauss in dual-machine mode, also known as a high-availability (HA) setup, involves setting up two openGauss instances where one acts as the primary server and the other as the standby server. The primary server handles all read-write operations, while the standby server replicates the data from the primary and can take over in the event of a failover.\n\nHere are some precautions to consider when setting up openGauss in dual-machine mode:\n\n1. **Same Version**: Ensure that both the primary and standby servers are running the same version of openGauss.版本一致性\n\n2. **Network Configuration**: Both servers should be on a reliable and fast network. Ensure that there is no network segmentation between the two servers that would prevent them from communicating.\n\n3. **Storage Replication**: The storage used by both servers should support data replication. Common configurations use shared storage like Synchronous Data Replication (SDR) or Asynchronous Data Replication (ADR).\n\n4. **Correct Configuration of `replication_source`**: On the standby server, the `replication_source` parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file must be set to the primary server's IP address and the correct port.\n\n5. **Primary and Standby Identification**: It's important to visually distinguish between the primary and standby servers in the physical layout, server names, or IP addresses to avoid confusion.\n\n6. **SSH Configuration**: For managing the remote server, configure SSH keys for passwordless login to simplify management tasks.\n\n7. **Firewall and Security Group Settings**: Ensure that the firewall on both servers allows traffic on the replication ports (by default, 2601 and 2602).\n\n8. **Resource Allocation**: Both servers should have adequate CPU, memory, and I/O resources to handle the workload. The standby server should not be underutilized as it needs to keep a copy of the data up to date.\n\n9. **Time Sync**: Ensure that the clocks on both servers are synchronized. A significant time skew can cause replication issues.\n\n10. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement monitoring for both servers to track performance, replication lag, and to get alerts for any issues that may arise.\n\n11. **Backup and Recovery Plan**: Have a solid backup and recovery plan in place. Regularly test the recovery process to ensure that the standby can successfully take over the primary.\n\n12. **Documentation**: Document the configuration and setup steps. This will be crucial for troubleshooting and for future maintenance tasks.\n\n13. **Failover Testing**: Regularly test the failover process to ensure that the system responds correctly in case of a disaster.\n\n14. **Updates and Patches**: Keep both the openGauss servers and the underlying operating systems up to date with the latest patches and updates.\n\n15. **Understand the Architecture**: Make sure that all team members understand the dual-machine architecture and the roles of primary and standby servers.\n\nBy following these precautions, you can help ensure a smooth and reliable operation of openGauss in dual-machine mode.",
        "expected_output": "When starting openGauss in dual-machine mode, the following precautions should be noted:\n\n1. It must be started in dual-machine mode. If the process is started in single-machine mode in the middle, it must be repaired to restore the dual-machine relationship. The repair method is to use the command `gs_ctl build` for repair. For specific usage of the `gs_ctl` command, please refer to the \"openGauss Tool Reference\" document.\n\nAccording to the documentation, the precaution for starting openGauss in dual-machine mode is that it must be started in dual-machine mode, otherwise repair is needed to restore the dual-machine relationship.",
