        "actual_output": "The algorithms for calculating standard deviation in SQL Server, using the `STDEV` and `STDEVP` functions, are based on well-established statistical formulas. However, the exact implementation details are proprietary to Microsoft. Nonetheless, we can discuss the mathematical principles behind these functions, which are common across many platforms.\n\n### STDEV (Sample Standard Deviation)\n\nThe `STDEV` function calculates the sample standard deviation of a set of values. The formula used is:\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( s \\) is the sample standard deviation.\n- \\( N \\) is the number of non-null values.\n- \\( x_i \\) represents each non-null value in the set.\n- \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the sample mean of the non-null values.\n\n### STDEVP (Population Standard Deviation)\n\nThe `STDEVP` function calculates the population standard deviation of a set of values. The formula for this is:\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu)^2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the population standard deviation.\n- \\( N \\) is the number of non-null values.\n- \\( x_i \\) represents each non-null value in the set.\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the population mean of the non-null values.\n\n### SQL Server Implementation\n\nWhile the exact code behind SQL Server's implementation of these functions is not publicly available, the calculations are based on these statistical principles. SQL Server processes these functions as part of its Transact-SQL (T-SQL) language, efficiently handling the computation over the data stored in your tables.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere's how you might use these functions in SQL Server:\n\n```sql\n-- Calculate sample standard deviation\nSELECT STDEV(column_name) AS SampleStdDev\nFROM table_name;\n\n-- Calculate population standard deviation\nSELECT STDEVP(column_name) AS PopulationStdDev\nFROM table_name;\n```\n\nReplace `column_name` with the name of the column you're analyzing and `table_name` with the name of your table.\n\n### Trusted Sources\n\nFor trusted information on these functions, refer to the official Microsoft documentation:\n- [STDEV (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/stdev-transact-sql)\n- [STDEVP (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/stdevp-transact-sql)\n\nThese resources provide authoritative details on the usage, syntax, and behavior of the `STDEV` and `STDEVP` functions in SQL Server, directly from the developers of SQL Server.",
        "expected_output": "In SQL Server, the STDEVP function calculates the Population Standard Deviation, while the STDEV function calculates the Sample Standard Deviation. To understand the difference between these two types of standard deviations, you can refer to this detailed explanation: [Sample Standard Deviation vs Population Standard Deviation](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/15098/sample-standard-deviation-vs-population-standard-deviation).\n\nWhen using the STDEV function in SQL Server, it's important to consider that it calculates the standard deviation of a sample, which means it uses Bessel's correction to provide an unbiased estimation of the population standard deviation. On the other hand, the STDEVP function calculates the standard deviation of a population without applying Bessel's correction.\n\nIf you need further clarification or want to explore more about standard deviation calculations in SQL Server, feel free to ask for additional resources or examples.",

        "input": "MySQL query to select join from 5 tables\n\nI have 5 tables:\n\n\n```\ntag: {tagID,tagDetails}\nuser: {userID,userDetails,u_status=[active or banned]}\nsubscribe: {tagID,userID}\nitem: {itemID, itemDetails,i_status=[active or banned]}\nitem_tag: {tagID,itemID}\n```\n\nI want to select these data:\n\n\n```\nresult: {tagID, tagDetails, num_subscribers, num_items}\n```\n\nFor each tagID, num\\_subscribers is the number of users under the table user whose u\\_status is 'active' and whose userID and the said tagID exists in the table subscribe\n\nFor each tagID, num\\_items is the number of users under the table item whose i\\_status is 'active' and whose itemID and the said tagID exists in the table item\\_tag\n\nAlso, I want all the tagID to appears in the result. If there are no users subscribing or items associated with that tagID, the record will be \n\n\n```\n{tagID,tagDetails,0,0}\n```\n\nWhat is the best (as 'human readable' as possible) one nested query that produce this result?",
        "actual_output": "To achieve the desired result, you can use a combination of `LEFT JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and conditional aggregation to count the number of subscribers and items per tag. The query below is structured to be as readable as possible, breaking down the process into clear steps:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    t.tagID, \n    t.tagDetails,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN u.u_status = 'active' THEN s.userID END) AS num_subscribers,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN i.i_status = 'active' THEN it.itemID END) AS num_items\nFROM \n    tag t\nLEFT JOIN \n    subscribe s ON t.tagID = s.tagID\nLEFT JOIN \n    user u ON s.userID = u.userID AND u.u_status = 'active'\nLEFT JOIN \n    item_tag it ON t.tagID = it.tagID\nLEFT JOIN \n    item i ON it.itemID = i.itemID AND i.i_status = 'active'\nGROUP BY \n    t.tagID, t.tagDetails\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **FROM tag t**: The query starts from the `tag` table because you want all `tagID`s to appear in the result, regardless of whether there are subscribers or items associated with them.\n\n2. **LEFT JOIN subscribe s ON t.tagID = s.tagID**: This joins the `subscribe` table to find all subscriptions related to each tag. Using `LEFT JOIN` ensures that tags without subscriptions are still included.\n\n3. **LEFT JOIN user u ON s.userID = u.userID AND u.u_status = 'active'**: This joins the `user` table to find all active users who are subscribed to each tag. The condition `u.u_status = 'active'` is placed directly in the `JOIN` clause to filter out inactive users early in the process.\n\n4. **LEFT JOIN item_tag it ON t.tagID = it.tagID**: Similar to the subscription join, this joins the `item_tag` table to find all items associated with each tag.\n\n5. **LEFT JOIN item i ON it.itemID = i.itemID AND i.i_status = 'active'**: This joins the `item` table to count only active items associated with each tag. Again, the condition `i.i_status = 'active'` is in the `JOIN` clause to filter out inactive items.\n\n6. **COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ... THEN ... END)**: Conditional aggregation is used to count the number of unique subscribers and items per tag. The `CASE` statement inside `COUNT` ensures that only records meeting specific conditions (active users or items) are counted. `DISTINCT` is used to ensure that each user or item is counted only once per tag, which is necessary because the joins might produce duplicate rows for users or items associated with multiple tags.\n\n7. **GROUP BY t.tagID, t.tagDetails**: Groups the results by `tagID` and `tagDetails` to ensure that the counts are calculated per tag.\n\nThis query provides a comprehensive overview of each tag, including the number of active subscribers and active items associated with it, ensuring that even tags without subscribers or items will be included with counts of 0, as per the conditional aggregation logic.",
        "expected_output": "Certainly! Here is a more specific and approachable version of the answer:\n\nTo retrieve the desired data, you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT T.tagID, T.tagDetails, \n       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN U.u_status = 'active' THEN U.userID END) AS num_subscribers, \n       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN I.i_status = 'active' THEN I.itemID END) AS num_items\nFROM tag T\nLEFT JOIN subscribe S ON T.tagID = S.tagID\nLEFT JOIN user U ON S.userID = U.userID\nLEFT JOIN item_tag IT ON T.tagID = IT.tagID\nLEFT JOIN item I ON IT.itemID = I.itemID\nGROUP BY T.tagID, T.tagDetails\n```\n\nThis query will provide the `tagID`, `tagDetails`, number of active subscribers (`num_subscribers`), and number of active items (`num_items`) for each tag. If there are no subscribers or items associated with a tag, it will display `0` for both counts.\n\nYou can adjust the query to fit your specific database schema and naming conventions.",
