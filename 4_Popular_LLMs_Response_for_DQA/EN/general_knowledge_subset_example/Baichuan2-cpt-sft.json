When my database connection gets errored out or when there is delay observed in connecting to the database, I want the output as \"Not connected\". In case it gets connected, my output should be \"Connected\". It is a Oracle databse.\n\nWhen there is delay in database connectivity, my code is not working and my script gets hung. What changes should I make in my code so that it is able to handle both the conditions(when I get an error connecting to the database and when there is delay observed in connecting to the database)??\n\n\n```\nif sqlplus $DB_USER/$DB_PASS@$DB_INSTANCE< /dev/null | grep 'Connected to'; then\necho \"Connectivity is OK\"\nelse\necho \"No Connectivity\"\nfi\n```",
        "actual_output": " To ensure your script can handle both errors in database connectivity and delays, you need to modify your code to include a timeout setting. This will prevent your script from getting stuck while waiting for the database connection. \n\nHere is how you can adjust your script:\n\n1. Add a timeout parameter after the `sqlplus` command:\n   \n   ```bash\n   if sqlplus $DB_USER/$DB_PASS@$DB_INSTANCE < /dev/null timeout 5; then\n       echo \"Connectivity is OK\"\n   else\n       echo \"No Connectivity\"\n   fi\n   ```\n\n2. Set the timeout value based on your requirements. You can adjust the number of seconds (e.g., 5 seconds) to suit your needs.\n\nBy adding the timeout parameter, your script will now exit gracefully after a specified time if the database connection fails or experiences delays. This will help prevent your script from getting stuck and ensure it can handle various scenarios effectively.",
        "expected_output": "The first thing to add to your code is a timeout. Checking database connectivity is not easy and there can be all kinds of problems in the various layers that your connection passes. A timeout gives you the option to break out of a hanging session and continue the task with reporting that the connection failed.\n\ngoogleFu gave me a few nice examples:\n[Timeout a command in bash without unnecessary delay](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/687948/timeout-a-command-in-bash-without-unnecessary-delay)",
