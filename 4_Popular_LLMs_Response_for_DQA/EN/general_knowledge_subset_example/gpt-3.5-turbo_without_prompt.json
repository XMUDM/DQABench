        "input": "When I update a table in Microsoft Visual Studio, it gets stuck at Preparing update script... forever\n\nI am a student and my assignment is to create a database with a couple simple tables. But when I update one of them, I can no longer update it again or update any other tables because I get stuck in the Preview Database Updates window, where the text says Preparing update script... forever until I click cancel. How can I fix it so I can update and create table's.",
        "output": "There are a few potential solutions you can try to fix this issue:\n\n1. Restart Visual Studio: Sometimes simply restarting Visual Studio can resolve the issue. Close the program and reopen it to see if the problem persists.\n\n2. Check for updates: Make sure you have the latest updates and patches installed for Visual Studio. Sometimes bugs and issues are fixed in newer versions of the software.\n\n3. Clear the cache: Clearing the cache in Visual Studio can sometimes resolve update issues. You can do this by going to Tools > Options > Environment > General and clicking on the \"Clear All caches\" button.\n\n4. Check for errors in your SQL script: Make sure there are no errors in your SQL script that could be causing the update to fail. Check for syntax errors or any other issues that could be preventing the update from completing.\n\n5. Try running the update script manually: If the automatic update is not working, you can try running the update script manually. Open the SQL Server Management Studio and run the update script directly on the database.\n\n6. Rebuild the database project: If none of the above solutions work, you can try rebuilding the database project in Visual Studio. Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select \"Rebuild\" to see if that resolves the issue.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, you may need to seek further assistance from your instructor or a technical support specialist to help troubleshoot the issue."

        "input": "Mysqli or custom database class?\n\nI was wondering if a custom database class is really needed. I mean: I have seen a lot of database abstraction layers and custom database classes all over the web. But why should we reinvent the wheel? Why shouldn't i use just the mysqli native class and extend it if i really need?\nThe mysqli class is secure, up to date and native. Why do people create their own classes with a `query()` method, a `fetch()` method and a `free()` method while they already exists?\nMysqli has prepared statements too, it is one of the safest way to keep sql injection out of there.",
        "output": "\n\nThere are a few reasons why someone might choose to create their own custom database class instead of using the mysqli native class:\n\n1. Abstraction: By creating a custom database class, developers can abstract away the complexities of interacting directly with the mysqli class. This can make their code more readable and maintainable.\n\n2. Flexibility: A custom database class can be tailored to specific project requirements and provide additional functionality that may not be available in the mysqli class.\n\n3. Code organization: Having a custom database class can help organize database-related code in a more structured manner, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n\n4. Dependency injection: Using a custom database class allows for easier implementation of dependency injection, which can improve code reusability and testability.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use a custom database class or the mysqli native class will depend on the specific requirements and preferences of the developer and the project at hand. Both options have their own advantages and drawbacks, so it's important to carefully consider which approach best suits the needs of the project."
