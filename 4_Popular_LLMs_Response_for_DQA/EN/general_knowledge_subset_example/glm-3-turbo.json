        "actual_output": "To merge datetime ranges in Oracle SQL, you can use a combination of SQL queries and possibly the `GAPS BETWEEN` clause if you are using Oracle 12c or later. The idea is to first find the gaps between the start and end times, and then merge the adjacent records that don't have a gap.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Find the gaps between the start and end times using a subquery or a common table expression (CTE).\n2. Merge the adjacent records that don't have a gap.\n\nHere's an example using a CTE to find the gaps:\n\n```sql\nWITH gaps AS (\n  SELECT\n    order_id,\n    start_date_time,\n    end_date_time,\n    LEAD(start_date_time) OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY start_date_time) AS next_start\n  FROM\n    your_table\n),\ngaps_with_duration AS (\n  SELECT\n    g.order_id,\n    g.start_date_time,\n    g.end_date_time,\n    GAP_SECONDS := (g.next_start - g.start_date_time) - INTERVAL '1 SECOND' * (LEAD(end_date_time) OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY start_date_time) - g.end_date_time)\n  FROM\n    gaps g\n)\nSELECT\n  order_id,\n  MIN(start_date_time) AS start_date_time,\n  MAX(end_date_time) AS end_date_time\nFROM\n  gaps_with_duration\nGROUP BY\n  order_id\nORDER BY\n  order_id;\n```\n\nReplace `your_table` with the name of your table. This query first finds the gaps between the start and end times using the `LEAD` function and then calculates the duration of the gaps. Finally, it groups the records by `order_id` and selects the minimum start time and maximum end time for each order.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the gaps between the start and end times are at least 1 second. If the gaps can be smaller than 1 second, you may need to adjust the calculation of `GAP_SECONDS`.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!",
        "expected_output": "To merge datetime ranges in Oracle SQL or PL/SQL, you can use the following query. This query will help you combine overlapping datetime ranges for each `order_id`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT order_id,\n       start_date_time,\n       end_date_time\nFROM   (\n  SELECT order_id,\n         LAG( dt ) OVER ( PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY dt ) AS start_date_time,\n         dt AS end_date_time,\n         start_end\n  FROM   (\n    SELECT order_id,\n           dt,\n           CASE SUM( value ) OVER ( PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY dt ASC, value DESC, ROWNUM ) * value\n             WHEN 1 THEN 'start'\n             WHEN 0 THEN 'end'\n           END AS start_end\n    FROM   table_name\n    UNPIVOT ( dt FOR value IN ( start_date_time AS 1, end_date_time AS -1 ) )\n  )\n  WHERE start_end IS NOT NULL\n)\nWHERE  start_end = 'end';\n```\n\nIn Oracle 12 and above, you can also utilize `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` for row-by-row processing:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM   table_name\nMATCH_RECOGNIZE(\n  PARTITION BY order_id\n  ORDER     BY start_date_time\n  MEASURES\n    FIRST(start_date_time) AS start_date_time,\n    MAX(end_date_time)     AS end_date_time\n  ONE ROW PER MATCH\n  PATTERN (overlapping_rows* last_row)\n  DEFINE\n    overlapping_rows AS NEXT(start_date_time) <= MAX(end_date_time)\n)\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust the table name and column names in the queries to match your database schema. You can run these queries in your Oracle database to merge overlapping datetime ranges efficiently.\n\nHere is an example of the expected output after merging the datetime ranges:\n\n```\nORDER_ID | START_DATE_TIME     | END_DATE_TIME      \n-------: | :------------------ | :------------------\n    3933 | 2020-02-04 08:00:00 | 2020-02-04 12:00:00\n    3933 | 2020-02-04 13:30:00 | 2020-02-04 19:00:00\n    3933 | 2020-02-05 13:40:12 | 2020-02-05 18:55:12\n    3933 | 2020-02-06 08:00:00 | 2020-02-06 12:00:00\n    3933 | 2020-02-06 13:30:00 | 2020-02-06 18:49:48\n    3933 | 2020-02-07 08:00:00 | 2020-02-07 12:00:00\n    3933 | 2020-02-07 13:30:00 | 2020-02-07 17:00:00\n   11919 | 2020-05-14 09:00:00 | 2020-05-14 17:00:00\n   11919 | 2020-05-15 08:40:12 | 2020-05-15 16:30:00\n   11919 | 2020-05-18 08:49:48 | 2020-05-18 09:45:00\n   11919 | 2020-05-18 10:00:00 | 2020-05-18 17:00:00\n```\n\nYou can try these queries in your Oracle database environment to effectively merge datetime ranges for your data.",

        "expected_output": "To update only the last entered value for a specific student in your database table, you can achieve this by incorporating an ordering column to determine the latest entry. This ordering column could be a timestamp, an incrementing ID, or any other sequential identifier. Assuming you have such a column named `ordering_column`, you can use the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses in your `UPDATE` statement to target the latest entry for a particular student.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your Python code using the MySQL connector to achieve this:\n\n```python\nsql = \"\"\"\n    UPDATE library \n    SET status = 'Returned', date_returned = %s \n    WHERE student_id = %s\n    ORDER BY ordering_column DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n\"\"\"\n\ncon = mysql.connect(host='localhost', user='root', password='*****', database='DB')\nc = con.cursor()\nc.execute(sql, (str(cal.selection_get()), e_sch.get(), ))\ncon.commit()\ncon.close()\n\nmessagebox.showinfo('Success', 'Book has been returned successfully')\n```\n\nIn this updated code snippet, the `ORDER BY ordering_column DESC` ensures that the latest entry for the specified student is updated. Additionally, I've modified the code to use parameterized queries for security and efficiency reasons.
