        "input": "Access Newly Created PostgreSQL Cluster\n\nI am looking to create a new database cluster in PostgreSQL because I want this cluster to point to a different (and larger) data directory than my current cluster on localhost:5432. To create a new cluster, I ran the command below. However, after restarting PostgresSQL I don't see the db cluster in pgAdmin and can't connect to a server with port 5435. How do I connect to this new cluster? Alternatively, I thought I could create a new tablespace within the old cluster which points to this larger data directory, but I'm assuming that populating a database using this tablespace would still result in files being written to the cluster data directory? I'm running PostgreSQL 9.3 on Ubuntu 12.4.\n\n\n```\n$ pg_createcluster -d /home/foo 9.3 test_env\n\nCreating new cluster 9.3/test_env ...\n  config /etc/postgresql/9.3/test_env\n  data   /home/foo/\n  locale en_US.UTF-8\n  port   5435\n```",
        "actual_output": "To access the newly created PostgreSQL cluster, you need to start the cluster and then configure pgAdmin to connect to it. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Start the cluster:\n```\n$ pg_ctlcluster 9.3 test_env start\n```\nThis command starts the PostgreSQL cluster with the name `test_env` and version `9.3`.\n\n2. Verify that the cluster is running:\n```\n$ pg_ctlcluster 9.3 test_env status\n```\nThis command should output the status of the cluster, including the port number it is listening on.\n\n3. Configure pgAdmin to connect to the new cluster:\n\t* Open pgAdmin and create a new connection:\n\t\t+ Go to \"File\" > \"Add Server\" > \"PostgreSQL Server\"\n\t\t+ Enter the hostname as `localhost` (or the IP address of your machine)\n\t\t+ Enter the port number as `5435` (or the port number output by `pg_ctlcluster`)\n\t\t+ Enter the username and password as `postgres` (or the username and password you specified when creating the cluster)\n\t* Save the connection and you should be able to see the new cluster in the pgAdmin tree view.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `psql` command-line tool to connect to the new cluster:\n```\n$ psql -h localhost -p 5435 -U postgres\n```\nThis command connects to the PostgreSQL cluster on `localhost` port `5435` as the `postgres` user.\n\nRegarding your second question, you are correct that creating a new tablespace within the old cluster would not change the location of the data files. To use the larger data directory, you would need to create a new cluster as described above.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `/home/foo` with the actual path to the data directory you want to use for the new cluster.",
        "expected_output": "You need to specify option '--start' if you want it to actually start the database. Without that it will just create the data directory.\n\nHowever using table spaces would probably be a better solution since running multiple database clusters introduces the overhead of running completely separate postmaster processes. If you create a database in a table space then all files associated with the database will go in the associated directory. The system catalogue will still be in the cluster's data directory, but this is unlikely to be large enough to cause you any problems.",

        "input": "How to separate automatically populated tables from manually populated tables, properly, in SQL Server?\n\nLets say I have the following 2 tables in a database:\n\n\n```\n[Movies] (Scheme: Automatic)\n----------------------------\nMovieID\nName\n\n[Comments] (Scheme: Manual)\n----------------------------\nCommentID\nMovieID\nText\n```\n\nThe \"Movies\" table gets updated by a service every 10 minutes and the \"Comments\" table gets updated manually by the users of the database.\n\nNormally you'd just create a simple foreign-key relationship between the two tables with cascading updates and deletes but in this case I want to be able to keep the manually entered data even if the movie it refers to gets deleted (the update service isn't that reliable). This should only be a problem in one-to-many releationships from an automatic table to a manual table. How would you separate the manual and the automatically populated parts of the database?\n\nI was planning to add a foreign-key that isn't maintaining referencial integrity and only cascades updates, not deletions. But are there any pitfalls I should be aware of by doing it this way? I mean, except the fact that I might end up with some of the manual data that doesn't actually reference anything.\n\n**Edit / Clarification:**\n\nJust to clarify. The example tables are totally made up. In reality the DB will contain objects like servers, applications, application notes, versions numbers etc. Server related information will be populated automatically but some application details will be filled in manually. It could be information like special configurations and such. Even if the server record gets deleted the application notes on that server are still valuable and shouldn't be deleted.",
        "actual_output": "To separate automatically populated tables from manually populated tables, you can create a separate table to store the relationships between the two types of tables. This approach is often referred to as a \"bridge table\" or \"junction table\".\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\nCreate a new table to store the relationships between the \"Movies\" table and the \"Comments\" table:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE MovieComments (\n    MovieID INT,\n    CommentID INT,\n    PRIMARY KEY (MovieID, CommentID)\n);\n```\nThis table will store the relationships between the \"Movies\" table and the \"Comments\" table. The primary key is a composite key that combines the \"MovieID\" and \"CommentID\" columns.\n\nNow, you can modify the \"Comments\" table to remove the foreign key constraint that references the \"Movies\" table:\n```sql\nALTER TABLE Comments\nDROP CONSTRAINT FK_Comments_Movies;\n```\nNext, you can create a new foreign key constraint on the \"MovieComments\" table that references the \"Movies\" table:\n```sql\nALTER TABLE MovieComments\nADD CONSTRAINT FK_MovieComments_Movies\nFOREIGN KEY (MovieID) REFERENCES Movies (MovieID);\n```\nThis foreign key constraint will ensure that the \"MovieID\" column in the \"MovieComments\" table references a valid \"MovieID\" in the \"Movies\" table.\n\nTo prevent the deletion of comments when a movie is deleted, you can create a trigger on the \"Movies\" table that updates the \"MovieComments\" table when a movie is deleted:\n```sql\nCREATE TRIGGER tr_DeleteMovie\nON Movies\nAFTER DELETE\nAS\nBEGIN\n    UPDATE mc\n    SET mc.MovieID = NULL\n    FROM MovieComments mc\n    WHERE mc.MovieID = DELETED.MovieID;\nEND;\n```\nThis trigger will update the \"MovieComments\" table by setting the \"MovieID\" column to NULL when a movie is deleted. This will effectively \"orphan\" the comments, so they are no longer associated with a specific movie.\n\nBy using a bridge table and a trigger, you can separate the automatically populated tables from the manually populated tables and prevent the deletion of comments when a movie is deleted.\n\nAs for the pitfall you mentioned, you are correct that using a foreign key that doesn't maintain referential integrity can lead to inconsistencies in the data. However, in this case, the bridge table and trigger approach ensures that the relationships between the tables are maintained, even if the movie is deleted.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this approach can be extended to other types of relationships between automatically populated tables and manually populated tables.",
        "expected_output": "I'd suggest you use an import table that gets updated by the service and then populate the movies tables from that. Then you get to keep movies that are deleted in the movies table. Possible tagging them as deleted or obsolete, but you'd still be able to keep them for historical purposes.",
