        "input": "What is the best approach to process a huge amount of rows in Laravel using Datatables?\n\nI have a problem with displaying more than 3000 rows (this number is going to be increased in an exponential rate). \n\n1. I'm currently returning the data in a collection from a MYSQL database. Should I use Laravel Eloquent or Query Builder for a better performance in my controller?\n2. Should I return the data in a JSON file format, will this help speed things up?\n3. Is there a way to add, delete, edit rows in the datatables without actually returning the view every time?\n\nIf you could provide an explanation with some articles that could help, that would be great. I tried to find something to put me on the best path to handle a huge amount of data, but no luck.\n\nRegards,\nJames",
        "output": "1. When dealing with a large amount of data in Laravel using Datatables, it is generally recommended to use Laravel Eloquent for better performance. Eloquent provides a more expressive and convenient way to interact with your database compared to Query Builder.\n\n2. Returning the data in a JSON format can help speed up the process as it reduces the amount of data being transferred between the server and the client. This can improve the overall performance of your application, especially when dealing with a large number of rows.\n\n3. To add, delete, or edit rows in Datatables without reloading the entire view, you can use AJAX requests to interact with the server-side data. This allows you to make changes to the data without refreshing the page, providing a smoother user experience.\n\nI recommend checking out the official Laravel documentation on Eloquent and AJAX requests for more detailed information and examples on how to efficiently handle a large amount of data in your Laravel application. Additionally, you can also refer to online tutorials and articles on optimizing database performance in Laravel to further enhance your understanding."

        "input": "How can i update tables from one database to another having a same sql server?\n\nI am trying to update a table from one database to another database having a same server. For example: Table1 has a certain columns with values in database\\_1, in case if my Table1 gets updated with the new values it has to sync the data to the database2.\n\nIn short Database1, Table1 has to be copied to Database2 \nBut complete copyig is not necessary every time. may updation is sufficient. \n\ndatabase1.Table 1: 1,2,3,4,5\ndatabase2.Table 2: 1,2,3\n\nhow this 4,5 can be updated in database2 ? \nThank you.",
        "output": "One way to update tables from one database to another on the same SQL server is by using the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or by writing a SQL query. \n\nYou can use the following steps to update the data in database2.Table2 with the new values from database1.Table1:\n\n1. Connect to the SQL Server Management Studio.\n2. Open a new query window.\n3. Write a SQL query to update the data in database2.Table2 with the new values from database1.Table1. \n   For example, you can use the UPDATE statement with a JOIN to update the matching rows in database2.Table2 with the values from database1.Table1.\n4. Execute the query to update the data in database2.Table2.\n\nBy following these steps, you can update the data in database2.Table2 with the new values from database1.Table1 without the need for complete copying every time."
