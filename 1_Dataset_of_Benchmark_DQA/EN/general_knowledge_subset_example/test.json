        "question": "Ensure order when select two rows using two identifiers on the same column\n\nI'm trying to write a query to retrieve exactly two rows from a table using the same column for identification.\n\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM teams WHERE name = $1 OR name = $2;\n```\n\nIs there any way to ensure that the result for `name = $1` is the first result returned and `name = $2` is the second?",
        "answer": "To retrieve exactly two rows from a table using the same column for identification and ensure a specific order, you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * \nFROM teams \nWHERE name IN ($1, $2)\nORDER BY CASE WHEN name = $1 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END;\n```\n\nThis query will first filter the rows based on the specified names and then order the results so that the row with `name = $1` appears first followed by the row with `name = $2`. The `CASE` statement in the `ORDER BY` clause assigns a value of 0 to the row where `name = $1` and 1 to all other rows, ensuring the desired order.\n\nIf you need to retrieve more than two rows and maintain a specific order based on multiple identifiers, you can expand the `CASE` statement accordingly to prioritize the order of the rows based on your requirements.",

        "question": "Reduce complexity in this database design\n\nThe database structure is like this : each user has create their list , and have a access right assign:\n\nFor example\n\n\n```\ntable: user\nattribute: UserID\n\ntable: list\nattribute: ListID\n\ntable: user_list\nattribute: ListID,UserID, Rights\n```\n\nThere are two kind of rights :read , edit\n\nEverything work fine until i have a rights call public ( everyone can edit)\nSo that if i have 100 member with 10 list, i have to create 1000 userID - Rights: edit rows\n\nthat is incredibly increase in scale. \n\nHow to solve this:\n\n1)Create separate table named public and put the ListID in it?\n\n2) Store the row as ListID , null UserID, and with Rights 'Public'?\n\nWhich method is better? Thank you.",
        "answer": "To simplify the database design and address the issue of scalability with user rights, you can consider the following approach:\n\nInstead of creating individual rows for each user's rights, you can enhance the list table by adding an `IsPublic` field. This field can indicate whether a list is public or not. By setting this field to true for public lists, you can eliminate the need to manage specific user rights for those lists. This can significantly reduce the number of rows in the user_list table and streamline the process.\n\nAdditionally, if you are concerned about the increasing number of rows in the user_list table, you can modify its structure to include fields like `UserID`, `ListID`, `CanEdit`, and `CanRead`. This approach allows you to store user-specific permissions efficiently. However, it is essential to consider the potential growth of user rights and the impact on performance before implementing this solution.\n\nBy incorporating the `IsPublic` field in the list table and optimizing the user_list table structure, you can effectively manage public lists and user rights while maintaining database performance and scalability.",
